## Releases

This NPM package is published automatically on every push to the `trunk` branch. Be sure to use proper Git commit messages so that the version will be bumped properly and release notes can be automatically generated.

- Refer to https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format
- To avoid triggering a release, such as for a README-only change, include `[skip release]` in your commit message.
